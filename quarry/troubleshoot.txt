Error: 0

An error of 0 means the game ended without any issues.

Error: 1

An error of 1 means that a file is missing in a resource pack, or the one that
has been selected has been deleted. To fix this, go into "gameInfo.json".

In your text editor, change the text after '"resource pack":' (without the speech
marks obviously) to "main". It should look like this now.

{"resource pack":"main","gridded":true,"icon":"pick.png"}

Error: 2

An error of 2 means that a game file, located outside of resource packs are missing.
To fix this, the best way is to restart the game. Make sure you have saved all your
quarries outside of the game!

Error: 3

An error of 3 means that something went wrong with the interpreter that runs the code.
These are often bugs located in Python (the language quarry is made in), or the computer
that runs it. For the first option, i would just wait until it gets updated to a new
version of python, and for the second option, just buy a better computer.
